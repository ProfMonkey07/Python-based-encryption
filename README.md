# Python-based-encryption
this is a program that uses pythons random number generator to encrypt text files
 
 the console with ask encrypt or decrypt
 to encrypt something, type encrypt and hit enter
 for decryption, type decrypt, same thing
 
 to do both of these you will need a key
 whether you are communicating with someone else, just yourself, or another program
 you will need a key
 
 this key can be any number, longer keys are more secure
 
 the program will ask you to put in the key, if you encrypt with a key, you need that same one to decrypt
 enter the key
 
 the program will now ask you what file you wish to encrypt, it will work with any text file, and most other text based files too but untested
 the program will hten create a new file with the encrypted or decrypted text
